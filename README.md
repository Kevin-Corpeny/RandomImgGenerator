A simple random image generator using random.randint(0,255) to color an 850x1100 image pixel by pixel.
Certainly improvements to be made, but even in this form it creates and saves the images quite quickly. 

Works in python 3

100_better.sh is a rudimentary shell script which will run the python script 100 times in succession. 
BE CAREFUL as keyboard interrupts don't seem to stop it, need to address that later.
